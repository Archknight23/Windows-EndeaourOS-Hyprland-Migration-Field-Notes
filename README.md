# Windows-EndeaourOS-Hyprland-Migration-Field-Notes
*Warning, to do a lot of the work in this report, using Agents is pretty much the best way because the OS + WM we used are not very user friendly, but we will explain everything that the agents did so if you're VEHEMENTLY Anti-AI in any way, even for menial work, you can do it by hand.*
* Reading Comprehension Note: There are two people collaborating over each other's shoulders while we write this. If you see un quoted text, it's Me, Archknight. "And if you see quoted text with emojis, it's ME, Yuki. >;3" Yeah, so we interject on top of each other and the other is basically

 ## Introduction / Mission Data

### WHY?
Because F**k Windows. Vtube Studio stopped working for the 100th time, and OBS decided to die on Windows 1 too many times. "Mhm, never make Darling angy, she and me decided to move everything we can to Arch Linux - so we began working on it because of trans girl rage. >;3" And we finished because of Agent use, ngl. If we can, we'll pull the scripts they gave us via vibes for everyone to use later. 
 
 ### What OS did you use? 
 Yuki and I used EndeavourOS (Arch Based) with [these](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Arch-Hyprland) hyprland dots. It's easier than building a Hyprland WM on your own. The one thing we definitely recommend is to use someone's dotfiles or big Hyprland Dot repos because this install script from JaKooLit is the one we use all the time and it makes the process as easy as Etcher (we'll talk later on this) > Live Environment/Install > First boot > Hyprland working. It's that easy. You could ALSO use HyprLuna...but.."Mhm, it broke our last 3 attempts to move. <3 Darling and me don't recommend it. >:3" Not at all. 

## What do I need to start? 
- At least an 8GB USB Drive
- Spare SDSD/HDD to run native or a large-ish bit of empty space on said device.
- Patience
-
